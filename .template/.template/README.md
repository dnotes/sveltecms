# Welcome to SvelteKit and SvelteCMS!

SvelteCMS is a new kind of CMS that runs in your browser or on serverless functions
as part of your SvelteKit site.

## Installation

1. `npm create sveltecms`

    Since you're reading this file, you've probably already done this part.

2. `npm install`

    You have to do this before anything will work. :)

3. (optional) `npx svelte-add tailwindcss --tailwindcss-typography`

    Tailwind CSS cooperates really well with SvelteCMS; if you install it,
    you'll be able to use Tailwind classes in your Display configurations
    and content files, which is one way to make your pages look the way
    you want them to look.

## Usage

1. `npm run dev`

    You should be able to run your site immediately after installing everything.
