Installing SvelteCMS is easy:

```

> npm create sveltecms@latest
> npm run dev

```

After it is installed, you should be able to begin creating content through the Admin UI. You can also build out Fields and Content Types much as you might with any other CMS.

In the coming days we will post some tutorials related to starting a site with SvelteCMS.
