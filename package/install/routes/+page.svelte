<h1>Welcome to SvelteCMS!</h1>

<p>
  To get started, visit the <a href="/admin">Admin UI</a>.
</p>

<p>
  For a quick demonstration, try
  <a href="/admin/content/page/_">creating a new page</a>
  with the slug "front".

  After you have your front page created, you can delete this file,
  which is at <code><pre>src/routes/+page.svelte</pre></code>
