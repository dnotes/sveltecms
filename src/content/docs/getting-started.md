## Installation

Install SvelteCMS locally with NPM:

```

> npm create sveltecms@latest
> npm run dev

```

## Try a WebContainer

If you're feeling adventurous, you can [try SvelteCMS using the Web Container API on StackBlitz](#){.stackblitz}. There are some significant bugs, but it's neat to see some progress toward a world where a CMS might be available to a site's content editors without having to maintain a server -- even if part of the site is built statically.
